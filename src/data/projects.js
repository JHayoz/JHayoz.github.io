    name: 'High-contrast spectroscopy with the new VLT/ERIS instrument',
    summary: "In this project, we used the new ERIS instrument at the Very Large Telescope to study AF Lep b, a young gas-giant exoplanet about four times the mass of Jupiter. The planet orbits its star at a distance similar to Saturn's orbit in the Solar System and is bright enough in infrared light to be directly imaged with modern high-contrast instruments. \nOne major goal of the study was to probe the atmosphere of AF Lep b. Using high-contrast spectroscopy in the K band and a technique called molecular mapping, we were able to detect clear signatures of water vapor (H₂O) and carbon monoxide (CO) in the atmosphere of the planet. At the same time, we did not detect methane, even though it is expected at these temperatures in chemical equilibrium. This mismatch suggests that the atmosphere is in chemical disequilibrium, likely driven by vertical mixing that brings CO-rich gas upward. \nWe also measured the radial velocity of the planet, allowing us to determine whether AF Lep b is moving toward or away from Earth. This resolved a longstanding ambiguity in its orbit: the planet is currently moving away from its host star, letting us identify the true 3-dimensional orientation of its orbit for the first time. This measurement is important for planning future observations, especially with upcoming facilities like the ELT that may observe AF Lep b - or other, smaller exoplanets - in reflected light. \nFinally, our work demonstrates the high performance of the ERIS instrument, achieving detections at contrasts of 1:50'000 and showing potential sensitivity to planets at extremely small angular separations. This opens the door to studying exoplanets that were previously beyond the reach of direct imaging.",

    name: 'Commissioning of the new ERIS/NIX High-Contrast Imager at the Very Large Telescope',
    summary: "The Enhanced Resolution Imager and Spectrograph (ERIS) is a new Infrared instrument at the Very Large Telescope. With its state-of-the-art Adaptive Optics system, it offers diffraction-limited normal and high-contrast imaging between 1 and 5 microns, and integral field spectroscopy between 1 and 2.5 microns. Our group contributed to the design and manufacturing of the imaging subsystem, called NIX, in 2018. Our group built precise cryogenic mechanisms for the instrument, including the Aperture Wheel and the Pupil and Filter Wheel, which operate at 70 K with micron-level accuracy. Additionally, we tested optical components like Apodized Phase Masks for exoplanet imaging.\nI contributed to the ERIS project in 2024 by participating in the commissioning of its High-Contrast Imaging modes, which consist of two coronagraphs and three sparse aperture masks. These modes are key to directly detecting and characterising faint substellar objects, like low-mass Brown Dwarfs and super-Jovian exoplanets. Commissioning tasks included measuring the operational functionalities of each observing mode, as well as their throughput, sensitivity, and contrast capabilities.\nFollowing first light, ERIS is now entering scientific operations. Our team continues to exploit guaranteed-time and open-call observations with NIX, enabling exciting new discoveries with this state-of-the-art infrared instrument.",

    name: 'CROCODILE: Incorporating medium-resolution spectroscopy of close-in directly imaged exoplanets into atmospheric retrievals via cross-correlation',
    summary: "In this work we introduce CROCODILE (<b>CRO</b>ss-<b>CO</b>rrelation retrievals of <b>D</b>irectly-<b>I</b>maged self-<b>L</b>uminous <b>E</b>xoplanets), a Bayesian framework that for the first time combines three major observational techniques used for directly imaged exoplanets: photometry, low-resolution spectroscopy, and medium-resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy.\nExoplanets close to bright host stars often suffer from “stellar speckle” contamination, which makes extracting a clean planetary spectrum difficult, especially for medium or high spectral resolution. CROCODILE overcomes this by using appropriate likelihood functions to treat all three data types jointly, yielding a statistically robust retrieval of atmospheric parameters. When tested on simulated observations of self-luminous gas giants (similar to widely studied planets like β Pictoris b), the combined retrieval significantly outperforms analyses that use any single technique alone, improving the accuracy of atmospheric parameter estimates by on average ~20%.\nOur study also finds that using medium-resolution cross-correlation data alone (e.g. in K band with resolution R~4000) is insufficient to reliably constrain atmospheric properties. Instead, optimal performance requires combining it with photometry (e.g. in Y and M bands) and low-resolution spectroscopy (e.g. Y-H bands).\nOverall, CROCODILE represents a major step forward in the atmospheric characterisation of directly imaged exoplanets. It is well suited for current and upcoming high-performance instruments, such as ERIS at the Very Large Telescope (VLT), as well as future instruments like the mid-infrared spectrograph on the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), offering the prospect of more precise atmospheric measurements for a wide range of exoplanets.",
